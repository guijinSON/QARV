# QARV (Question and Answers with Regional Variance)
```EleutherAI Community Project```

The QARV (Question and Answers with Regional Variance) project aims to curate a collection of questions with answers that exhibit regional variations across different nations. 

## Goals
1. Curating a dataset of questions and answers exhibiting regional variations across nations. (Coverage to be discussed.)
2. Observing biases in language models regarding regional contexts.
3. Exploring whether ICL, prompting, SFT, or RLHF can be used to steer language models towards generating culturally-aware responses.
